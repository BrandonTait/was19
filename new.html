<h1>About Brando</h1>

<p>My name is Brandon Tait. I was born on October 15, 1997, in Brooklyn NY. I am 21 years old. I'm a graduating senior Computer Information Systems major. After graduation I'll be returning to NY to work with JP Morgan Chase as a software engineer. I'm excited to graduate and start
working, but it's also bittersweet because I'll miss all my friends and the Howard fun.</p>
